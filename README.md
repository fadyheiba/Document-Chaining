# Document-Chaining
Redirects to a target app of similar structure, re-applying the selections from the source app.

Document chaining is a method used to deal with Big Data apps when they get too large. If the app contains 5 years of historical information, you can divide the app into 5 smaller ones and move from one to the other using this extension. It's a fairly easy and clean process, before resorting to On Demand App Generation.

If you're in the 2016 app with California and 3 sales reps selected, and you'd like to see their performance in 2013, you would click on the 2013 button and it would take you to the 2013 app with California and the 3 sales reps selected there. There would be another button for the 2016 app in the 2013 app so you can go back to your original analysis.
